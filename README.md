Thank you for the additional information. I have updated the `README.md` file for the "Scrcpy GUI by EXPOSUREEE" application to include the camera mirroring feature. Here is the updated version:

# Scrcpy GUI by EXPOSUREEE

Scrcpy GUI by EXPOSUREEE is a graphical user interface for Scrcpy that makes it easier to use. The GUI has a simple and intuitive interface, and it allows you to control all of the same features as the command-line version.

## Introduction

Scrcpy is a free and open-source screen mirroring application that allows control of an Android device from a Windows desktop computer. It does not require rooting or the installation or running of an app on the Android device. The screen content is streamed as H.264 video, which the software then decodes and displays on the computer. The software pushes keyboard and mouse input to the Android device over the server.

## Problem

While Scrcpy is a great tool, it can be difficult to use for some people. The command-line interface can be daunting, and it can be hard to remember all of the keyboard shortcuts.
